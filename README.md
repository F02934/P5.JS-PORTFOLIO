# P5.JS-PORTFOLIO

### **PORTFOLIO OF WORKS P5.JS**

Introduction
-
When I started my sketches, my ideas were not already there, I started by for example thinking of doing a sketch with particles system, and slowly when writing the code and doing research on the internet the ideas were coming. So my sketches were always changing without a clear path, just following my imagination.

Sketch 1

The first sketch was made with L system. Using a button called "grow tree" every time that is pressed the tree grows, The image represents the button pressed 5 times (more than that and my computer would crash). The text "world tree" is used to give great importance to it, the tree looks celestial and mighty. The text is between the quotations mark because I was inspired by artist and designer Virgil Abloh.
The background created with the use of "NOISE", it's aesthetical pleasant to me. I also added a slide to change its colour.

Sketch 2

Sketch number 2 with the help of particles system I created rain, that is perpetually falling. I made it so that every time particles reach a certain height they return to the top changing position (between 0, -400). The sound of rain is added to make it more realistic. The button "stop-time" literally stop the time, in fact, the rain and the sound all stops, and you will see the screen as in the images of the sketches above. The slide is added to change the background because I added multiple images to it(5), so you can choose the best one for you. For me it makes you feel like teleporting in a very calm location without people, to pause from life for a bit.

Sketch 3

In this sketch the mood is party, the sketch is very colourful and lively. An ellipse that slowly goes from bottom to top and top to bottom, followed by rectangles, all of them are reacting to the sound or music the louder it is the bigger it gets. Even the words "party" and the background react to the sound changing ins size for the text and colour for the background. There's a sound visualizer in the bottom too that react in the same aways as all the elements in this sketch. It is so messy and colourful that makes you feel like in a club.

In this sketch, balls get out from a black hole. They are dancing around the strange square in the middle because attracted by it. The square is made by giving a random RGBA to every pixel within the square. The background is white, it feels like nothingness. I watched movies and cartoons during my life, sometimes I encountered the scene for a people reach this place all white with nothing, watching it gave made me feel a weird sensation and afraid of such places.
